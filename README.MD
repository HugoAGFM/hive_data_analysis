## Introduction

This work proposes to briefly analyze a dataset containing Brazil highway traffic accidents data using Apache Hive.

## About Dataset

The dataset under analysis is available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcamera/brazil-highway-traffic-accidents) and contains data from Brazil's federal higways between 2007 and 2021 at various levels of granularity. 

The level of granularity chosen was 'accidents per person', and, because there's been  a change in the system used to record these data in 2017, this analysis will be restricted to the period of 2017 to 2021.

### Columns description

Below you can find the columns present in the dataset with a brief description, and how they've been mapped to each table in the data model.

| Accidents | Accidents records. Relates to table People through column 'pesid', and with table Vehicles through column 'id_veiculo'. |
| People    | Information about the people involved in the accidents. Relates to the table Accidents through column 'pesid'.           |
| Vehicles  | Information about the veicles involved in the accidents. Relates to the table Accidents thorugh column 'id_veiculo'.                                                |

## Preparing Environment

This session contains all the steps taken to prepare the analytical environment.

**Prerequisites**
- Install terraform and gcloud cli

## Analysis

This session contains the set of analytical questions elaborated to explore the dataset. Along with each question, there will be the link to queries executed and the results with a brief discussion.

### What is the vehicle type with the highest driver death rate? [query](./hive/queries/driver_death_rate_per_vehicle_type.q)

#### Results

| Vehicle type | Deaths | Accidents | Death rate [%] |
| :----------- | :----: | :-------: | :------------: |
| Quadricycle  |   2    |     9     |     22.22      |
| Bicycle      |  932   |   8787    |     10.60      |
| Wheelbarrow  |   2    |    25     |      8.0       |
| Moped        |  117   |   1661    |      7.04      |
| Motorcycle   |  5626  |  107284   |      5.24      |

#### Discussion

Although the Quadricycle has the highest death rate, due to the low number of occurencies, it is possible to consider that the Bicycle as the vehicle with highest death rate.

### Does the number of people in the vehicle influence the occurrences of accidents where the driver sleeps? [query](./hive/queries/sleeping_driver.q)

#### Results

| Number of people     | Sleeping driver accidents | Total accidents | Rate [%] |
| :------------ | :----------------------------: | :-------------: | :------: |
| Just one      |              5971              |     105690      |   5.64   |
| More than one |              6111              |     215042      |   2.84   |

#### Discussion

When compared to the total number of accidents per number of people in the vehicle, the ones where the driver sleeps happens twice more when there is only one person in the vehicle.

### Which federal unit has the highest death rate by person involved in an accident? [query](./hive/queries/fu_death_rate.q)

#### Results

| Federal Unit | Dead People | Involved People | Death rate [%] |
| :----------- | :---------: | :-------------: | :------------: |
| MA           |    1022     |      14081      |      7.25      |
| AL           |     418     |      7228       |      5.78      |
| TO           |     380     |      6718       |      5.65      |
| BA           |    2284     |      41653      |      5.48      |
| PA           |     647     |      12424      |      5.20      |

#### Discussion

Maranh√£o is the State with the highest death rate per people involved in an accident. Beyond that, it is important to notice that only States from the North and Northeast regions are in the top 5.

### What is the highway with the highest number of accidents each year? [query](./hive/queries/accidents_per_highway_per_year.q)

#### Results

| Year | Highway | Accidents |
| :--- | :-----: | :-------: |
| 2017 |   101   |   10596   |
| 2018 |   101   |   8095    |
| 2019 |   101   |   7969    |
| 2020 |   101   |   7321    |
| 2021 |   101   |   3735    |

#### Discussion

The biggest highway in the Country, BR 101, is also the one with the highest number of accidents every year. It is important to notice that this number decreased throughout the years.


### What are the stages of the day where an accident involving someone in an altered mental stage is more likely to happen? [query](./hive/queries/altered_mental_state_per_day_stage.q)

#### Results

| Day Stage | Altered mental state accidents | Total accidents | Rate [%] |
| :-------- | :----------------------------: | :-------------: | :------: |
| Night     |             16096              |     111170      |  14.47   |
| Dawn      |              1500              |      15588      |   9.62   |
| Nightfall |              1343              |      17708      |   7.58   |
| Day       |              6965              |     176269      |   3.95   |

#### Discussion

When compared to the total number of accidents, the ones where someone is in an altered menthal state are more likely to happen during the night or dawn.

## Future work

For future work, there are three options to highlight:
1. Enrich dataset with data of public construction in the highways and traffic signaling updates to check if they impacted the accidents throughout the year.
2. Enrich the dataset with weather data throughout the year to analyze how they impact the accidents.
3. Treat data from the period of 2007 to 2016 in an attempt to inlcude it the analysis.
